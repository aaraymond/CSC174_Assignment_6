            	<h2>IT Consultant - Dallas Computer Solutions (DCS)</h2>

                <p>Working at DCS expanded my knowledge in communications and problem solving through the installation and management of hundreds of computers. Managing the computer network for a large commercial real estate company was my primary task and in doing so I gained valuable experience in the corporate setting including setting up and ensuring conference rooms were prepared in advance of meetings and all computers were connected and fully prepared for presentations. My talents also included managing customerâ€™s Macs in conjunction with Windows Small Business Server.</p>

                <h2>Web Design - Cheyanna's Champions 4 Children</h2>

                <p>I designed multiple web pages using Wordpress templates in conjuction with custom HTML and CSS. I integrated the front-end design with back-end database software and PHP forms.</p>

				<h2>Photography - University of Rochester</h2>

                <p>I used the simple scroll example provided py Professor Kostin. I downloaded two typefaces, one from Behance and one from Google Fonts.</p>

                <p>For the typeface choices, I looked at the shapes of the letters to determine which style best suited eachother. For example, the "w" of both typefaces has flat bottoms and tops, which pair well together.</p>

                <p>My inspiration was Bang & Olufsen. Their website has a very modern feel with many long scrolly type pages that are artfully layed out in F or Z patterns.</p>
